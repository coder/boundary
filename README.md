# jail

**Network isolation tool for monitoring and restricting HTTP/HTTPS requests from processes**

jail creates an isolated network environment for target processes, intercepting all HTTP/HTTPS traffic through a transparent proxy that enforces user-defined allow rules.

## Features

- üîí **Process-level network isolation** - Linux namespaces, macOS process groups
- üåê **HTTP/HTTPS interception** - Transparent proxy with TLS certificate injection
- üéØ **Wildcard pattern matching** - Simple `*` wildcards for URL patterns
- üìù **Request logging** - Monitor and log all HTTP/HTTPS requests
- üñ•Ô∏è **Cross-platform** - Native support for Linux and macOS
- ‚ö° **Zero configuration** - Works out of the box with sensible defaults
- üõ°Ô∏è **Default deny-all** - Secure by default, only allow what you explicitly permit

## Quick Start

### Installation

**From GitHub Releases (Recommended):**
```bash
# Download the latest release for your platform
wget https://github.com/coder/jail/releases/latest/download/jail-linux-amd64.tar.gz
tar -xzf jail-linux-amd64.tar.gz
chmod +x jail
sudo mv jail /usr/local/bin/
```

**Build from Source:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/coder/jail
cd jail
make build  # or: go build -o jail ./cmd/jail
```

### Usage

```bash
# Allow only requests to github.com
jail --allow "github.com" -- curl https://github.com

# Allow full access to GitHub issues API, but only GET/HEAD elsewhere on GitHub
jail \
  --allow "github.com/api/issues/*" \
  --allow "GET,HEAD github.com" \
  -- npm install

# Default deny-all: everything is blocked unless explicitly allowed
jail -- curl https://example.com
```

### Unprivileged Mode (NEW!)

jail now supports running without elevated privileges using the `--unprivileged` flag:

```bash
# No sudo required!
jail --unprivileged --allow "github.com" -- curl https://github.com

# Works with complex applications
jail --unprivileged --allow "*.npmjs.org" -- npm install

# Same rule engine and proxy functionality as privileged mode
jail --unprivileged --allow "api.example.com" -- ./my-app
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Run as regular user, NOT with sudo**
```bash
# ‚úÖ CORRECT - Run as regular user
jail --unprivileged --allow "github.com" -- curl https://github.com

# ‚ùå WRONG - Don't use sudo with --unprivileged
sudo jail --unprivileged --allow "github.com" -- curl https://github.com

# ‚úÖ For privileged mode, use sudo WITHOUT --unprivileged
sudo jail --allow "github.com" -- curl https://github.com
```

**Requirements for Unprivileged Mode:**
- Linux (kernel 2.6+)
- Applications that respect proxy environment variables (HTTP_PROXY, HTTPS_PROXY)

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ **No sudo required** - Runs as regular user
- ‚úÖ **No external dependencies** - Uses built-in proxy environment variables
- ‚úÖ **Container-friendly** - Works in restricted environments
- ‚úÖ **Same rule engine** - Identical allow/block logic as privileged mode

## Allow Rules

jail uses simple wildcard patterns for URL matching.

### Rule Format

```text
--allow "pattern"
--allow "METHOD[,METHOD] pattern"
```

- If only a pattern is provided, all HTTP methods are allowed
- If methods are provided, only those HTTP methods are allowed (case-insensitive)
- Patterns use wildcards: `*` (matches any characters)

### Examples

```bash
# Basic patterns
jail --allow "github.com" -- git pull

# Wildcard patterns
jail --allow "*.github.com" -- npm install    # GitHub subdomains
jail --allow "api.*" -- ./app                 # Any API domain

# Method-specific rules
jail --allow "GET,HEAD api.github.com" -- curl https://api.github.com
```

**Default Policy:** All traffic is denied unless explicitly allowed.

## Logging

```bash
# Monitor all requests with info logging
jail --log-level info --allow "*" -- npm install

# Debug logging for troubleshooting
jail --log-level debug --allow "github.com" -- git pull

# Error-only logging
jail --log-level error --allow "*" -- ./app
```

**Log Levels:**
- `error`: Shows only errors
- `warn`: Shows blocked requests and errors (default)
- `info`: Shows all requests (allowed and blocked)
- `debug`: Shows detailed information including TLS operations

## Blocked Request Messages

When a request is blocked, jail provides helpful guidance:

```
üö´ Request Blocked by Jail

Request: GET /
Host: google.com
Reason: No matching allow rules (default deny-all policy)

To allow this request, restart jail with:
  --allow "google.com"                    # Allow all methods to this host
  --allow "GET google.com"          # Allow only GET requests to this host

## Platform Support

| Platform | Implementation | Sudo Required |
|----------|----------------|--------------|
| Linux | Network namespaces + iptables | Yes |
| **Linux (Unprivileged)** | **Proxy environment variables** | **No** |
| macOS | Process groups + PF rules | Yes |
| Windows | Not supported | - |

## Troubleshooting Unprivileged Mode

### "permission denied" for `/root/.config`
```bash
Error: failed to create certificate manager: failed to create config directory at /root/.config/coder_jail: mkdir /root/.config: permission denied
```
**Solution**: Don't use `sudo` with `--unprivileged`. Run as regular user:
```bash
# ‚ùå Wrong
sudo jail --unprivileged --allow "github.com" -- curl https://github.com

# ‚úÖ Correct  
jail --unprivileged --allow "github.com" -- curl https://github.com
```

### Applications not respecting proxy settings
```bash
# Some applications may ignore proxy environment variables
# Check your application's documentation for proxy configuration
```
**Solution**: Use privileged mode for applications that don't respect proxy environment variables:
```bash
# For apps that ignore HTTP_PROXY/HTTPS_PROXY
sudo jail --allow "github.com" -- your-app
```
